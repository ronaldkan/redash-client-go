## Overview ##

A Simple API client library for interacting with Redash written in Go. 

## Quick start ##

### Using go modules (aka. `go mod`) ###

In your go files, simply use:
```go
import "github.com/snowplow-devops/redash-client-go/redash"
```

Then next `go mod tidy` or `go test` invocation will automatically
populate your `go.mod` with the last redash-client-go release, now
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/snowplow-devops/redash-client-go.svg)](https://github.com/snowplow-devops/redash-client-go/releases).
(Note you can use `go mod vendor` to vendor your dependencies.)

From there, you will need to setup a new client in order to access API methods:
```
config := redash.Config{
  RedashURI: "https://acme.com/",
  APIKey: "<Your personal API token from your Redash user profile>",
}

c, err := redash.NewClient(&config)
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(fmt.Errorf("Error loading client: %q", err))
  return
}
```

## Usage ##

Functional examples can be found in
* https://github.com/snowplow-devops/redash-client-go/tree/master/examples 

## Development ##

Assuming git installed:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow-devops/redash-client-go
$ cd redash-client-go
$ make test
```

To remove all build files:

```bash
$ make clean
```

To format the golang code in the source directory:

```bash
$ make format
```

**Note:** Always run `format` before submitting any code.

**Note:** The `make test` command also generates a code coverage file which can be found at `build/coverage/coverage.html`.
